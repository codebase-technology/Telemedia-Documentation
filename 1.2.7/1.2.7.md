# Telemedia Version 1.2.7 Changelog



### BT SIP Trunk support

> ##### Connectivity > SIP Trunks
>
> Note: Authentication Name is only relevant to BT SIP Trunks
>
> The trunk should be configured in the following way (**all details supplied by BT**):
>
> - **Username**: {*main-phone-number*}@{*company-domain*}
> - **Authentication Name**: {*authentication-username*}
> - **Carrier IP / Host**: {*BT-SBC-DNS-SRV-record*}

> As the trunks are configured it may take a further minute to become active.  This is while the system is inserting the necessary host entries in the /etc/hosts file.  Without these entries, all calls will fail.

### Call Recording Location (for additional storage devices)

> ##### Company > Recording Path
>
> Prior to using this feature, you must ensure you have connected additional storage and mounted the volume at **/mnt/recordings**
>
> *Note: If you are unable to see this setting, ensure it is enabled for Administrators in the **Users > Roles** section.*
>
> A directory alias must be setup in the Apache config to ensure Apache can access the folder.  Add the below to the config.
>
> `Alias /recalias /mnt/recordings
>     <Directory "/mnt/recordings">
>         Require all granted`
> 	`    </Directory>`

### Recording On As Default

> ##### Inbound > Numbers
>
> ##### Users > Extensions
>
> Call recording has now been set to on for all new numbers and extensions added to the system.  However, if the customer has not purchased call recording, the **Call Recordings** tab should not be enabled in the roles section.  This is off by default.
