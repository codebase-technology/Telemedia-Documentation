### Ability to choose the amount of days recording to save disk space (admin only)

> ##### Company > Company Info
>
> Admin users now have the ability to change the amount of days to save call recordings in order to save disk space.  This requires that the role you are assigned to has the 'Setting - Recording Days' permission granted as shown below.  **This permission must not be granted to end users.** Choosing any value over 30 days requires that the end user has purchased additional storage space.
