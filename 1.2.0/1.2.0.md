### DND state feeds back to the system

> DND functionality has been updated to inform the system that the phone is in a DND state, which will be displayed on all other phones where a 'Speed & BLF' feature key is assigned to the extension in DND.



### Improved Security

> Access to the backend API now requires an API_Key and UserID as well as the users credentials to improve security.  This allows the firewall to be relaxed on port 80 and as such there will be no need to whitelist IPs going forward.  This applied only to version 1.2.0 and up.



### Increased handset gain on calls

> Handset gain has been increased across the range of Yealink handsets as there we some complaints of being unable to hear clearly



### Increased Provisioning Security

> Re-provisioning files are only written upon extensions reboot or re-provision and are deleted automatically after 2 minutes.  Essentially, whenever provisioning a phone you have 2 minutes after created the extension to provision it.  After the initial 2 minutes you will be required to press the re-preovision button to give you a further 2 minutes.
