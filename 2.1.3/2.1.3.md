# Telemedia Version 2.1.3 Changelog


New feature code `*208` to enable divert to destination at the CLI level (individually) rather than company level.  See below for more information.

**Syntax**: 

`*208{3 digit destination code}{destination number}{CLI to apply to}`

**Implementaion**: The above feature code should be inserted as a speed dial on an extension's keys. Ensure that you include the '+' sign if it currently prepends the CLI. Refer to the inbound numbers for clarification.

**Example 1**:

`*208vms890+441611234567`

This will send all calls for +441611234567 to voicemail box 890

**Example 2**: 

`*208grp821+441611234567`

This will send all calls for +441611234567 to group 821
