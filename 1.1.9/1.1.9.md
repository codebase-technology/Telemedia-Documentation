# Telemedia Version 1.1.9 Changelog

### Re-provision button on the extensions tab to avoid reboot

> Ability to re-provision any Yealink handset without rebooting.  This allows the user to make quick changes to the phone's functionality without the need to reboot the phone which will disrupt the computer's network connection if using the pass through ethernet port

### Service monitoring script with auto-restart

> The system now includes a self-monitoring script which runs every minute, which will auto-restart the phone system service in the event of most failures.

### 9 For an outside line (optional)

> This feature will allow the customer to continue to press 9 for an outside number dial if they are used to that with their previous system.  Configuration is not required, the system will detect if 9 precedes an external number and simply strips it. 

### Voicemail storage increased

> Storage has been increased to allow the customer to store many more voicemails on the system.  Future iterations will automatically delete stored voicemails after 30 days.

### T58 Support 

> Support for the Yealink T58v with video camera has now been included and can be chosen in the portal when configuring the extension.

### Extensions - NAT support per extension

> NAT support has been enabled for each extension (default = no).  This allows the engineer to specify whether the device is sat behind a NAT firewall.  This is not required for cloud implementations, only use for on-premise Telemedia boxes.
