# Telemedia Version 1.2.1 Changelog

### Ability to add, edit and delete portal users

> All systems will be built with the default username and agreed default password, which must be changed here before putting the system into service.
>
> It is not necessary to generate an API Key for new users unless you intend to integrate into the system via any of the Telemedia apps or 3rd party apps.
>
> Here you can also select the role that the user inherits allowing you to specify granular permissions later.

### System checks for ‘in use’ numbers or blank fields when adding new features

> Should the system detect you are trying to use a number already in use it will refer you to the 'In use' report which follows below.

### DND state feeds back to the system

> DND functionality has been updated to inform the system that the phone is in a DND state, which will be displayed on all other phones where a 'Speed & BLF' feature key is assigned to the extension in DND.



### Improved Security

> Access to the backend API now requires an API_Key and UserID as well as the users credentials to improve security.  This allows the firewall to be relaxed on port 80 and as such there will be no need to whitelist IPs going forward.  This applied only to version 1.2.0 and up.



### Increased handset gain on calls

> Handset gain has been increased across the range of Yealink handsets as there we some complaints of being unable to hear clearly



### Increased Provisioning Security

> Re-provisioning files are only written upon extensions reboot or re-provision and are deleted automatically after 2 minutes.  Essentially, whenever provisioning a phone you have 2 minutes after creating the extension to provision it.  After the initial 2 minutes you will be required to press the re-preovision button to give you a further 2 minutes.

> As well as the IVR feature, Telemedia now offers Auto Attendant where the system will ask for a know extension number, allowing for direct call routing without the need for a receptionist.
